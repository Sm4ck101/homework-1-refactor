# Refactor Project
The objective I was given was to make Horiseon's website more accessible to 
individuals who have disabilities.  By changing multiple div elements to 
semantic elements I was able to organzie the website more suitable for disabled 
individuals. After implementing semantic elements I had to make edits to the CSS 
so the two codes would link together correctly. I was also able to fix a link 
that was not linking correctly in the HTML. I used my recently aquired knowledge 
of semantic elements to implement them in the real world. Horiseon's website now 
fully meets accessibility standards.
